# Rekengame

Years ago I made 'rekengame.nl' which was a randomly generated math website with levels, gold, tools etc.
This was in an attempt to game-ify maths, with a login system etc. using PHP in the backend with CodeIgniter.

This application was made as a client-side mimic.

## Prerequisites

In order to run this, you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed.

## Getting Started

The following steps allow you to setup the environment to run this application.

1. Git clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
